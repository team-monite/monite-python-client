        Returns a list of accounts payable invoices (bills) that exist in the entity's accounting system. This requires that an accounting connection has been previously established. Refer to the [Accounting integration guide](https://docs.monite.com/accounting/integration/index) for details.

        This endpoint only provides read-only access to the accounting system's data but does not pull those payables into Monite. You can use it to review the data in the accounting system and find out which of those payables already exist or do not exist in Monite.

        Data is actual as of the date and time of the last accounting synchronization, which is specified by the `last_pull` value in the response from `GET /accounting_connections/{connection_id}`. To make sure you are accessing the most up-to-date accounting data, you can use `POST /accounting_connections/{connection_id}/sync` to trigger on-demand synchronization before getting the list of payables.

        Parameters
        ----------
        limit : typing.Optional[int]
            Number of results per page.

        offset : typing.Optional[int]
            Number of results to skip before selecting items to return.

        request_options : typing.Optional[RequestOptions]
            Request-specific configuration.

        Returns
        -------
