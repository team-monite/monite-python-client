    A URL of the PDF file that shows the document state after the change. Available only for the following event types: `receivable_created`, `receivable_updated`, `status_changed`, and `payment_received`. In other event types the `current_pdf_url` value is `null`.
    
    In `payment_received` events, the `current_pdf_url` value is available only in case of full payments and only if the entity setting `generate_paid_invoice_pdf` is `true`.
    
    Note that Monite generates PDFs asynchronously. This means that the initial value of `current_pdf_url` for the abovementioned events right after they occurred is usually `null` and the value gets populated later after the PDF document has been generated.
